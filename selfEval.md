# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?
1. My time management could be much better. I tend to take too many breaks between problems and I prefer working later at night, which in turn sets me back on getting assignments completed early. I need to be better at getting stuff done early instead of using the last absolute last minute as motivation. I think having an accountability buddy would be very helpful.
- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is? A function is directions for the computer to follow.
- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters. Paramaters are the guidlines for the function to follow while arguments use those parameters to create a desired output.
- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?
At this point I would like to go deeper into combining equations with strings, maybe using some more intricate equations.
